#summary Description of cloudrun

= Introduction =
This project sets up an [http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/ Amazon (AWS) EC2 instance], with:
 * [http://dev.chromium.org/developers/testing/webkit-layout-tests DumpRenderTree]: a UI-less build of [https://www.google.com/chrome Google Chrome], 
 * [http://code.google.com/p/ouspg/wiki/Radamsa radamsa]: A fuzzer from Oulu University Secure Programming Group (OUSPG) 
 * samples, either Cascading Style Sheet, or png

Once setup, the instance executes forever (or more likely until stopped)the following sequence:
 * Generate a batch of fuzzed files (with [http://code.google.com/p/ouspg/wiki/Radamsa radamsa])
 * Renders html page(s) embedding the fuzzed files with [http://dev.chromium.org/developers/testing/webkit-layout-tests DumpRenderTree]
 * If a crash is detected, sends an email to an [http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/sns/latest/gsg/Subscribe.html AWS SNS configurable address]

The performance of the instance (number of test runs) can be monitored on the [http://aws.amazon.com/console/ Amazon management console] via the [http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/GettingStartedGuide/ViewGraphs.html AWS Cloudwatch service]


= AWS EC2 instance Setup =

The cloudrun project consists of a collection of Python, shell scripts, [http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook Linux upstart jobs] and configuration files.

These files are bundled into a multi-MIME part file, by the [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CloudInit CloudInit] utility. The resulting file serves as initialisation data to your Amazon EC2 instance.

When an EC2 instance starts up, that has the cloudinit package pre-installed (as is the case with all the [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEC/Images Ubuntu EC2 images]), this initialisation file is parsed and as a result:
 * Extra packages are installed
 * scripts and config files are extracted and installed at the relevant places
 * upstart jobs are scheduled

This allows for an entirely automated and consistent setup 

= Running the AWS EC2 instance =
That's the easiest part, since the setup is entirely automated, there is nothing to do apart from monitoring the mail address you provided as your [http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/sns/latest/gsg/Subscribe.html SNS endpoint]

You might also want to log into the [http://aws.amazon.com/console/ Amazon management console] to monitor the "cloudrun" metric, displayed as a  [http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/GettingStartedGuide/ViewGraphs.html graph showing the progress of the test runs]

= Environment supported =
This is Linux only.
The project dependencies are:
 * [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CloudInit cloudinit]
 * [http://boto.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html boto library] version >= 2.0
 * The amount of disk and memory required is fairly small and fits comfortably into the smallest AWS machines (i.e. [http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/ micro-instances])
 * an account named 'ubuntu' setup
These requirements naturally call for an [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEC/Images ubuntu AMI]
Since we need a boto library >=2.0, this limits our choice to at least an 11.10 ubuntu [http://cloud.ubuntu.com/ami/ ubuntu AMI], in any region, either 32 or 64 bits.

= Project setup =
The end result is a gzip multi-MIME part cloudinit file.
However, before this can be created succesfully, the template config/.boto  [http://code.google.com/p/boto/wiki/BotoConfig config file] needs to be edited, to add your [http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSSecurityCredentials/1.0/AboutAWSCredentials.html#AccessKeys AWS credentials] and your [http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/sns/latest/gsg/CreateTopic.html SNS topic ARN]

*Note for the cautious:* We understand that pasting credentials in a text file sounds fairly alarming :)
As explained [http://www.elastician.com/2010_09_01_archive.html in this nice posting], we recommend that you create a special "cloudrun" account, with the [http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/IAM/latest/GettingStartedGuide/Welcome.html?r=1527 AWS Identity and Access Management service].

Limit this account privilege to: s3:Get, sns:Publish, cloudwatch:PutMetricData, using the  [http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/ManagingPolicies.html AWS IAM Policy generator].
You can of course be even more restrictive and qualify the specific resource to which the permissions apply, i.e. the ARN SNS topic, Cloudwatch metric and the S3 Bucket & object.

Doing this will rule out a third party using your credentials to do expensive things, like launching extra instances.

If still not convinced, well, get in touch, if you ask nicely, I can make a Chromium build publicly available, so you can run, without providing any credentials at all.

=Generating the AWS EC2 initialisation file=
at the root of the cloudrun project is a Makefile, that has 4 targets:
ec2png, ec2css, kvmpng, kvmcss

to generate the png fuzzing test initialisation file, simply type :
{{{
make ec2png
}}}
This will create a: *userdata-cloud-init.ec2png.txt.gz* file, that you can provide as user data to your EC2 instance.

=Checking that the AWS EC2 instance started OK=
