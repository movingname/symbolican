This project tries to crash DumpRenderTree with inputs generated by the radamsa fuzzer.
DumpRenderTree is a UI-less build of Google Chrome, see: http://dev.chromium.org/developers/testing/webkit-layout-tests
radamsa is a fuzzer created by the Oulu University Secure Programming Group (OUSPG), see: http://code.google.com/p/ouspg/
All rights as asserted by respective owners, in above links.

The files and subdirectories in this directory, should have been setup automatically, during EC2 instance startup.
bootstrap.sh should have finished executed and run.sh should be running, check /var/log/cloudrun.log

File list
=========
bootstrap.sh
	setup the environment, fetches DumpRenderTree, radamsa and png input samples
run.sh
	executes DumpRenderTree over fuzzed samples repeatedly
notify.sh
	Invoked by other scripts to send a msg 
AWSSNSPublish.py
   Invoke AWS SNS Publish API through the boto library
test.sh (crash|samples)
	test DumpRenderTree in the environment
crash.html
	used by test.sh to crash DumpRenderTree, unless, this was fixed in version of DRT you are using
/tmp/iterN
	The number of iterations executed so far by run.sh 
results
	The radamsa seed(s) for crashes that were *hopefuly* found
cnt2TS.sh
   convert a running counter to a Time Series
putmetricIterN.sh
   call above script periodically to output iterN as a Time Series
AWSCloudWatchPutMetricData.py 
   Invoke the AWS CloudWatch PutMetricData api
InstanceID.sh
   call AWS metadata to retrieve the InstanceID and caches the result
